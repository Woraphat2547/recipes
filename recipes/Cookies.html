        <li>
            3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1+1/4 teaspoons baking powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1/8 teaspoon salt

    <ol>
        <li>
            Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg. Gradually stir in the sifted ingredients to form a soft dough. Divide dough into 2 pieces, flatten and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Dough will be sticky so be sure to add more flour to the rolling surface as needed. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto cookie sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
