        Crêpes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.

        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 cup all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>
            2 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup milk
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup water
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons butter, melted
        </li>
    </ul>

        Directions
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.
        </li>
